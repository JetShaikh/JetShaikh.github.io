        <ul>
            <p>You have decided to jump and by doing that you lost your... weapon and in fear you wet your pants as well so you stink. You get grabbed at by a Griffin, and you get dropped right in the middle of hatching eggs, you notice that these eggs are 2 times your size. They're all around you... What do you do? </p> 
            <p> You see that you still have your weapon, to decide to use that to escape, by using the feathers around you as wings to go down. But you end up in the middle of the maze.</p>
            <p> Fustrating, I know, well, on the bright side you lost the monster.</p>
        </ul>
