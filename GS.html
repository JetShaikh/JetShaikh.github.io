    <h1> You have gone straight </h1>
        <p> You have chosen to go straight. Good choice! You still have the item that you have chosen in the beginning. Now you wander the maze. You walk for a long time that seems like a couple of hours. But then you come across another difficult decision. You again have the choice to turn right, left, or continue going straight. One of these directions would lead you to the so called 'exit'. Choose wisely. </p>
